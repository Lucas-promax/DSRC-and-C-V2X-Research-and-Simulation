# DSRC-and-C-V2X-Research-and-Simulation 🚗📡

A research and simulation framework that systematically compares **DSRC (IEEE 802.11p)** and **C-V2X (3GPP PC5)** communication technologies in connected vehicles.  
This repository includes:

- 📘 Technology survey and mechanism analysis  
- 🧠 Mechanism-driven lightweight communication behavior modeling  
- 🚀 Multi-scenario DSRC vs. C-V2X performance simulation  
- 👁 Full-chain “Perception → Communication → Visualization” C-V2X system demo  
- 📊 Data-driven VANET communication performance visualization dashboard  

This project is based on practical coursework and research from **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**.
